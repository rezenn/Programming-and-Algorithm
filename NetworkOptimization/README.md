# Shortest-Path-GUI
About:
this project was done for a class project for my Data structure class at Queens College.it uses Dijkstra's algorithm
to find the shortest path from one point to another.

How to begin:
# download it and open the jar file or you can open the .java file and run it from your compiler.
# when a new window opens, add vertex on the right with area by clicking on add vertex,
# join all the vertex by clicking on add edges
# click on shortest path and select two vertex form where you want to find the shortest path.
# you can move the vertex by clicking on Move Vertex, can change the weight of the edges or add weight randomly.
# you can add all the edges by clicking on Add All Edges
# you can get minimal spanning tree by clicking on Minimal Spanning Tree.
